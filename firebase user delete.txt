Is there a way I can get a specific user account from firebase and then delete it?

For instance:

// I need a means of getting a specific auth user.
var user = firebase.auth().getUser(uid);
// Note the getUser function is not an actual function.
After, I want to delete that user and their additional data:

// This works
user.delete().then(function() {
   // User deleted.
   var ref = firebase.database().ref(
      "users/".concat(user.uid, "/")
   );
   ref.remove();
});
Firebase Documentation states that users can be deleted if they are currently logged in:

firebase.auth().currentUser.delete()
